I decided to learn how to program because it's interesting, challenging, and fun.  

During my previous job as a junior project manager and bug tester, I was surrounded by developers who were passionate about coding. I'd deal with their broken, misbehaving code, trying to figure out what went wrong and where it did. 

Occasionally, I'd get a chance to actually see it, the mystical code. And it would make sense to me, on some level. I never fully understood it, but peeking behind the curtain, so to speak, was kind of exciting. 

So, now I'm here, learning to code full-time and having a lot of fun. 

More to come soon.
